######## DEFAULT CONFIGURATION DEFINITION ########

##################################################
#### Script Common Configuration

# if the autoshutdown-script should be enabled or not
# default = "true"
#
# note:
# enabled/disabled does start the script on OMV, but then it checks, if the script
# is enabled or disabled. If it is "disabled", then the script stops with a log-message
ENABLE="true"

CYCLES=6
	# Set the number of cycles with no result (no PC online etc.) before shutdown. (default=6)
	# allowed is 1 - 999

SLEEP=180
	# Numbers of seconds between each Cycle (Check). (default=180, 3 min)
	# allowed is 1 - 9999

RANGE="2..254"
	# define a range of IPs which should be scanned, (default="2..254")
	# via XXX.XXX.XXX.xxx last triple of IP address in a list
	# The following scheme is mandatory
	# "v..v+m,w,x..x+n,y+o..y,z"
	# define an ip range :    <start>..<end> -> the two dots are mandatory
	# define a single ip :   <ip>
	# all list entries seperated by comma ','
	# Please make sure to leave 1 and 255 out of the list !
	# To disable a check for a IP, just set a "-"
	# -> RANGE="-"

####  Check Clock to identify uptime ####
CHECKCLOCKACTIVE="false"
	# parameter to activate or deactivate this feature (default="false")
	# per default this is deactivated

UPHOURS="06..20"
	# define a range of hours, in which the system should stay up (default="6..20")
	# without checking any other paramter to stay awake

##################################################
#### Network Socket Supervision Configuration
NSOCKETNUMBERS="22,139,445,10000,49152"
	# socket numbers to check for activity
	# (default="21,22,80,139,445,3689,6991,9091,49152")
	# Ports:
	# 21 = FTP
	# 22 = SSH
	# 80 = Web
	# 139 = NetBIOS
	# 443 = HTTPS
	# 445 = Samba-Filesharing
	# 548 = AFP
	# 3689 = iTunes, DAAP
	# 6991 = Bittorrent
	# 9091 = Transmission-Daemon-WebIF
	# 10000 = Webmin WebIF
	# 49152 = UPnP
	# 51413 = Bittorrent

ULDLCHECK="true"
	# (default=true)
	# set it to "true" for a network-traffic check. Then don't forget to set ULDLRATE also!

ULDLRATE=50
	# define the network traffic in kB/s
	# in each cycle autoshutdown checks whether the network-traffic (upload or download) is over the set value
	# over this value, no shutdown -> new check after x seconds (see SLEEP)
	# below this value, your PC shuts down, if all other checks are negative, too after the defined nr. of Cycles

LOADAVERAGECHECK="true"
	# set it to "true" for a check of loadaverage over the last minute in autoshutdown. If the system is
	# over this value, then no shutdown is issued.
	# If you set this to "true", don't forget to set LOADAVERAGE also!

LOADAVERAGE=40
	# Set this to the target loadaverage for the Server.
	# Make sure you leave the leading zeros and the dot out of the value!
	# Example:
	# LOADAVERAGE=50   # means a loadaverage of 0.50
	# LOADAVERAGE=8    # means a loadaverage of 0.08
	# LOADAVERAGE=220  # means a loadaverage of 2.20
	# and so on ...

HDDIOCHECK="true"
	# set it to "true" for a check of HDD-IO over the last SLEEP-time in autoshutdown. If the system is
	# over this value, then no shutdown is issued.
	# If you set this to "true", don't forget to set HDDIO-RATE also!

HDDIO_RATE=400
	# Set this to the target HDDIO-rate in kB/s for the Server.

CHECK_SAMBA="true"
    # If set to true, smbstatus will be checked for connected clients.

TRANSMISSIONDOWNLOAD="false"
	# Check transmission
	
CHECK_CLI="true"
    # If set to true, will check for connected users.

##################################################
#### Syslog Configuration ####
SYSLOG="true"
	# activate write to syslog (default="true")

VERBOSE="false"
	# use the verbose mode, with additional output on the command line (default="false")
	# verbose includes DEBUG-Mode

FAKE="false"
	# set it to "true" for a Fake-Mode: The script runs dry: You can test what happens, without shutting down your PC
	# This mode includes VERBOSE-output automatically, even if VERBOSE is set to "false"
	# Setting it to "false" or if it is not set, the script will run normally.
	# With Fake-Mode ON, the script doesn't sleep 5 minutes after it starts, so you can see what happens immediately

####### EXPERT SETTINGS ##########
##################################

# You should know, what you are doing
# Add these settings to the "Expert Settings" textfield in the OMV-GUI
# make sure # isn't the first character in the line if you add it

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Process Supervision Configuration

#LOADPROCNAMES="smbd,nfsd,transmission-daemon,mt-daapd,forked-daapd,your_processes_here"
                     # command names of processes with load dependent children
                     # checked by default="proftpd,smbd,nfsd,transmission-daemon,mt-daapd,forked-daapd")

#TEMPPROCNAMES="in.tftpd"
                     # command names of processes only started when active
					 # checked with "top" AND "ps", so all processes are found, even such, which doesn't show up in top
					 # like "lftp"
					 # Beware: If the process shows up in "ps" when there is no connection, your PC won't shutdown!
					 # maybe you have to call the process in you script like this: "lftp -do -something -here && exit"
					 # so that the process is killed after it has done something
                     # checked by default="in.tftpd")

	# if you want others, please uncomment the above lines and add your process at the end of the line
	# The following scheme is mandatory for both LOADPROCNAMES and TEMPPROCNAMES:
	# process1,process2
	# all processes separated by comma ','

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="pm-hibernate" # puts the PC in hibernate-mode
								# pm-suspend  # puts the PC in suspend-mode
								# shutdown -h +5  # shuts the PC down 5 min after shutdown-command

	# If you don't want to shutdown your PC, but go in hibernate/suspend: Define the command here
	# If nothing defined, it shuts down with "shutdown -h now"
	# For more information and how to set up hibernate and suspend, look here:
	# http://wiki.debian.org/Suspend
	# http://wiki.debian.org/Hibernation

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	# Here you can define a path to a file, which contains list of IPs that should be scanned
	# only one IP per line allowed - Format mmm.nnn.ooo.ppp
	# e.g.:
	# 192.168.1.45
	# If this expert-setting is used, the IPs specified in "RANGE" or in GUI doesn't work
	# If this is uncommented, the IPs specified in "RANGE" or in GUI doesn't work

#PINGLIST="PATH/TO/PINGLIST"

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#NETSTATWORD="VERBUNDEN"    # Set specific word, which specifies the connection in netstat
							# only needed for CLI-testing with VERBOSE!

	# It is needed, if someone wants to test autoshutdown.sh on the CLI, because on the CLI the netstat-output is language-specific.
	# At systemstart netstat-output is always english. For german Debian/Ubuntu = "VERBUNDEN", other languages: 'netstat -n'
	# on the CLI and you shoud see this output:

		# Aktive Internetverbindungen (ohne Server)
		# Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
		# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:2049     192.168.178.23:753      VERBUNDEN
		# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:22       192.168.178.23:53099    VERBUNDEN

	# now take the word under "State" -> "VERBUNDEN" and set it for NETSTATWORD


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#PLUGINCHECK="true"
	# PlugIns: You find sample plugins in /etc/autoshutdown.d
	# Set this to true, if autoshutdown.sh checks for PlugIns in /etc/autoshutdown.d
	# set it to "false" (or uncemmented) to skip the check
	#
	# E.g.: When ClamAV does a check, the Server shouldn't shut down
	# How to do that?
	# Let's look at a example: in the clamav-plugin for autoshutdown (etc/autoshutdown.d/clamav) the following is set:
	#
	#    # In which folder is the file to look for
	#    folder="/var/run/clamav"
	#    # filename (can be expanded with regexes)
	#    file="clamdscan-[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}"
	#
	# Then, if a file i.e.: clamdscan-aaaa3556-adfe-5678-abcdef012345 (or whatever UUID) in /var/run/clamav exists, the Server isn't shutdown
	#
	# also possible:
	#     folder="/home/user"
	#     file="backup.status"
	#     content="processing job"
	#
	# If a file /home/user/backup.status exists with the content 'processing job', the Server isn't shutdow
	# This is useful for backupscripts. It is not nice if the PC is shutting down while the backup-script is running.
	# In my backup-script i use a simple
	#
	#     echo "processing job" > /home/user/backup.status
	#
	# at the beginning and a
	#
	#     rm /home/user/backup.status
	#
	# at the end of the script. In the boot-Phase also a
	#
	#     rm /home/user/*.status
	#
	# to delete all *.status files, which are not deleted before (loss of power for example)
	#
	# Please have a look at the two example files in /etc/autoshutdown.d

#FORCE_NIC="eth1"
	# You can set NICs to look for a IP. This is useful, if you don't use eth0
	# make sure you insert a space between each NIC

	# see README
